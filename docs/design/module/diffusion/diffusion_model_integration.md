# Diffusion model integration

Diffusion model integration owns pipeline contracts, registration, checkpoint
loading, adapters, shared layers, and model-specific processing.

## Candidate invariants

### DIFF-MODEL-INV-001: Pipelines implement one runtime contract

**Rule:** A pipeline MUST declare its supported modalities, configuration,
inputs, outputs, loading path, and runtime capabilities.

### DIFF-MODEL-INV-002: Registration is the selection boundary

**Rule:** Runtime code MUST select model implementations through the registry or
loader contract rather than scattered model-name conditionals.

### DIFF-MODEL-INV-003: Model code does not schedule requests

**Rule:** Pipeline code MUST NOT own admission, batching, cancellation, or
cross-stage routing.

### DIFF-MODEL-INV-004: Shared behavior stays shared

**Rule:** Model directories SHOULD contain only genuine model differences.

## Safe-change guide

Test registry selection, checkpoint loading, minimal inference, input and output
contracts, and every declared optional capability.

### Hardware-specific block qualification

When a model selects native and vendor implementations of the same block,
qualify the extension seam before changing selection policy:

1. Load the same nontrivial state dict strictly into both implementations.
2. Exercise identity and channel-changing skip paths plus production mode
   branches.
3. Compare shape, dtype, and values with declared per-dtype tolerances.
4. Assert that the normal platform entry selects the intended class and that
   accelerated operations actually execute.
5. Restore process-global backend state after successful and failing calls.
6. Report block timings separately from model and request timings.

Block qualification does not replace checkpoint loading, generated-output
quality, or request-level validation through the normal model entry.
