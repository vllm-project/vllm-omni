# Distributed Layerwise Offloading

Distributed layerwise offloading (DLO) extends block streaming to multi-device
deployments. With AllGather enabled, each rank stores roughly `1 / dp_size` of
the host weights and reconstructs each layer at runtime. Without AllGather,
each rank streams its standard-loader rank-local weights independently.

See the [DLO feature design](../../../design/feature/offloader/distributed_layerwise_offload.md)
for the implementation contract and compatibility matrix.

## Execution model

DLO overlaps three operations with a fixed two-block device buffer:

```text
Compute stream:  [Layer N]          [Layer N+1]        [Layer N+2]
H2D stream:      [H2D shard N+1]    [H2D shard N+2]
AllGather:       [AG N+1]           [AG N+2]
Slots:           slot 0: Layer N    slot 1: Layer N+1
```

AllGather communicates only request-independent weight shards, so data-
parallel ranks may process different requests concurrently.

## Usage

```bash
# Four ranks with sharded host weights and AllGather
vllm serve /path/to/model --omni \
  --enable-distributed-layerwise-offload \
  --data-parallel-size 4

# Standard-loader rank-local weights, without DLO AllGather
vllm serve /path/to/model --omni \
  --enable-distributed-layerwise-offload \
  --data-parallel-size 4 \
  --dlo-no-use-allgather

# Sequence parallel deployment
vllm serve /path/to/model --omni \
  --enable-distributed-layerwise-offload \
  --usp 4
```

```python
from vllm_omni import Omni

omni = Omni(
    model="/path/to/model",
    enable_distributed_layerwise_offload=True,
    dlo_use_allgather=True,
)
```

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--enable-distributed-layerwise-offload` | Enable DLO | `false` |
| `--data-parallel-size N` | DP ranks and AllGather weight-sharding group | `1` |
| `--dlo-use-allgather` | Shard host weights and reconstruct with AllGather | `true` |
| `--dlo-no-use-allgather` | Keep standard-loader rank-local weights | `false` |
| `--dlo-resident-layers N` | Keep N leading main-DiT blocks on device; requires no-AllGather and model-declared resident paths | `0` |

## mmap weight loading

The DLO plus AllGather path:

1. saves non-persistent buffers such as RoPE frequencies;
2. moves the normally created transformer to the meta device;
3. loads checkpoint tensors as mmap views backed by the shared OS page cache;
4. calls model-specific `post_load_weights()` conversions; and
5. restores the saved non-persistent buffers.

This avoids one full checkpoint RSS copy per rank and does not require
model-specific loading code.

## Declarative topology

Models may declare an `OffloadPlan` instead of embedding offload logic:

```python
from vllm_omni.diffusion.offloader import OffloadPlan


class MyPipeline(nn.Module):
    _dit_modules = ["transformer"]
    _offload_plan = OffloadPlan(
        block_attrs={"transformer": ("blocks",)},
        offload_submodules={"context_encoder": "layers"},
    )
```

When no plan exists, discovery falls back to
`_layerwise_offload_blocks_attrs` and then heuristic attribute lookup.

## Data-parallel concurrency

With `data_parallel_size > 1` and AllGather enabled, the scheduler can process
up to `dp_size` requests per denoising step. Every concurrent request must set
the same explicit `num_inference_steps`; `None` is rejected because every rank
must enter each collective.

## Limitations

- Online FP8 quantization is rejected with the DLO plus AllGather mmap path.
  Use `--dlo-no-use-allgather` or disable online quantization.
- Tensor parallel size greater than one is rejected in the mmap path because
  it bypasses TP-aware loader callbacks. The no-AllGather path retains the
  standard loader and remains experimental with TP.
- HSDP plus AllGather is rejected to avoid double sharding. HSDP without
  AllGather has limited end-to-end validation.
- Resident leading layers require `--dlo-no-use-allgather` and a model
  `OffloadPlan` that declares eligible `resident_dit_paths`.
- DP concurrency requires an explicit, identical inference-step count.
