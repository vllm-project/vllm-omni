vLLM-omni: Multi-modality models inference and serving with non-autoregressive structures.

This package extends vLLM beyond traditional text-based, autoregressive generation
to support multi-modality models with non-autoregressive structures and non-textual outputs.

Architecture:
- 🟡 Modified: vLLM components modified for multimodal support  
- 🔴 Added: New components for multimodal and non-autoregressive processing
