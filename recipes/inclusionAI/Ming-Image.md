# Ming-Image 0.1 Design

> Text-to-image, image editing, and layer decomposition.

## Summary

- Vendor: inclusionAI
- Models: `inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design` and `inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design-Layer`
- Runtime: vLLM-Omni two-stage online serving
- API: OpenAI-compatible chat completions

## Architecture

Stage 0 uses a Qwen2.5-VL vision tower plus a 20-layer BailingMoeV2 language model.
It appends 256 learned image-query tokens and exports the final query states plus direct VLM states from layers 5, 12, and 20.
The query-token checkpoint is in the root sibling `mlp/` directory, so remote stage-0 materialization downloads both `mllm/` and `mlp/`.

Stage 1 projects those conditions through the checkpoint connector and runs a 30-layer Z-Image DiT with a Qwen-Image RGBA VAE.

For Design-Layer, the first returned image is the reconstructed composite and the remaining images are the requested layers.

## CUDA

### Environment

- OS: Linux
- Python: 3.10+
- CUDA: 13.0
- vLLM version: 0.29.0
- vLLM-Omni version or commit: 6daf5b30f
- 2x H100 80GB (1xH100 to be validated)

### Commands

```bash
MODEL=inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design
vllm serve "$MODEL" --omni --deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/ming_image.yaml --port 8091
```

For layer decomposition, set `MODEL` to `inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design-Layer`.

## Text-to-image

Note that a prompt refiner is expected to describe the prompts with details; we will refine with more example inputs soon.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "A clean editorial botanical poster"}],
    "modalities": ["image"],
    "extra_body": {
      "height": 1024, "width": 1024,
      "num_inference_steps": 12, "guidance_scale": 1.0, "seed": 42
    }
  }' \
  | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content[0].image_url.url | split(",")[1]' \
  | base64 -d > ming_design_smoke.png
```

## Image editing

Pass one input image and an editing instruction:

```bash
MODEL=inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design
INPUT_IMAGE=/path/to/input.png

jq -n \
  --arg model "$MODEL" \
  --rawfile image <(base64 -w0 "$INPUT_IMAGE") \
  '{
    model: $model,
    messages: [{role: "user", content: [
      {type: "image_url", image_url: {url: ("data:image/png;base64," + $image)}},
      {type: "text", text: "Change the background to blue"}
    ]}],
    modalities: ["image"],
    extra_body: {
      height: 1024, width: 1024,
      num_inference_steps: 12, guidance_scale: 1.0, seed: 42
    }
  }' |
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @- \
  | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content[0].image_url.url | split(",")[1]' \
  | base64 -d > ming_edit.png
```

## Layer decomposition

Use the Design-Layer checkpoint and set `INPUT_IMAGE` to a local flattened design image.
Note that the prompt should better depict each layer to be decomposed, we will refine with more example inputs soon.

```bash
MODEL=inclusionAI/Ming-Image-0.1-Design-Layer
INPUT_IMAGE=/path/to/input.png
PROMPT="Decompose this image into 6 layers with the following specifications: Number of layers: 6 \nLayer 1: Central text ... Layer 2: ... Layer 6: ..."

jq -n \
  --arg model "$MODEL" \
  --rawfile image <(base64 -w0 "$INPUT_IMAGE") \
  --arg prompt "$PROMPT" \
  '{
    model: $model,
    messages: [{role: "user", content: [
      {type: "image_url", image_url: {url: ("data:image/png;base64," + $image)}},
      {type: "text", text: $prompt}
    ]}],
    modalities: ["image"],
    extra_body: {
      num_layers: 6,
      height: 1024, width: 1024,
      num_inference_steps: 12, guidance_scale: 2.0, seed: 42
    }
  }' |
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @- > response.json

jq -r '.choices[0].message.content[].image_url.url | split(",")[1]' response.json |
  nl -v 0 |
  while read -r index data; do
    printf "%s" "$data" | base64 -d > "ming_layer_${index}.png"
  done
```

## FP8 quantization (stage 1)

Stage 1 (the dominant DiT stage) supports online FP8 with no calibrated
checkpoint — add one line to the stage-1 block of the deploy yaml (works
in either layout; measured on the co-located 1x H100 config):

```yaml
  - stage_id: 1
    quantization: fp8
```

Measured on 1x H100 80GB, co-located layout, 1024² / 12 steps / cfg 1.0 /
seed 42, checkpoint `Ming-Image-0.1-Design`, vLLM 0.31.0 / vLLM-Omni
099f9b553. The environment block at the top of this recipe reflects the
original 2x H100 validation; the numbers in this section come from the
same stack as the 1x H100 co-location validation (#8612), which also
updates the hardware line. Four prompts — the smoke prompt above plus:

- "A serene mountain lake at sunrise with mist over the water"
- "A vibrant street food market scene at night with neon signs"
- "A minimalist coffee brand logo with a mountain silhouette"

Quality metrics use 8-bit RGB (the checkpoint's alpha channel dropped),
`data_range=255`:

| Metric | BF16 | stage-1 FP8 |
|---|---|---|
| Stage-1 latency (steady requests) | ~2.0 s | ~1.2 s |
| Peak VRAM | 70.1 GiB | 64.3 GiB |

Quality gate vs the BF16 outputs at the same seed (lossy by construction;
SSIM / PSNR / LPIPS): 0.922 / 20.9 dB / 0.096 (botanical poster),
0.941 / 22.9 dB / 0.073 (mountain lake), 0.816 / 18.9 dB / 0.124 (street
market), 0.990 / 28.1 dB / 0.014 (minimal logo). Outputs stay coherent
generations; complex scenes drift the most, simple graphics barely move.
Server start pays one-time quantization plus compile (654 s vs 472 s for
BF16 in the same session on a shared host). If a scene regresses further
than acceptable, keep quality-sensitive linears in BF16 via
`ignored_layers` (see the `img_mlp` note in
`docs/user_guide/quantization/fp8.md`).

## Notes

- The default deployment keeps Stage 0 eager and enables dynamic regional
  compilation with CUDA Graph Trees for the repeated Stage 1 DiT blocks.
  The first request for each new image shape or layer count pays compilation
  and graph-capture cost; warm up every production shape before measuring or
  serving latency-sensitive traffic.
- Only one reference image and one request at a time are currently supported.
- Design-Layer requires a reference image except during warmup.
- A non-empty `negative_prompt` is rejected; Ming-Image uses zero negative conditioning.
- Height and width must be divisible by 16.
- Returned images retain the checkpoint's four RGBA channels.
