Cross-request voice isolation check for CosyVoice3 voice cloning (#8555).

Under concurrency a voice-cloning request can come back in the voice of another
request in flight at the same time (#8235, fixed by #8224). This test sends 32
seeded requests round-robin over 3 reference voices and asserts that every output
is closest to its own reference.

* Two independent speaker embedders score each output against all references:
  CosyVoice3's CAM++ (``campplus.onnx`` from the model snapshot) and
  ``microsoft/wavlm-base-plus-sv``.
* An output shorter than 0.5 s or silent is not scored and fails as a content problem.
* A leak is an output where both embedders agree on the same wrong voice. Zero leaks
  are allowed on the full output. The first 2 s is checked too, but the model alone
  sometimes opens a request in the wrong voice (nothing in flight), so at concurrency 8
  a wrong first 2 s counts only if the same request at concurrency 1 was right.
  The concurrency-1 controls assert the full output only and print the first-2 s labels.
* Speech content is checked by the ASR test. The speaker tests do not look at it.

Two ways of naming the voice are tested, each on its own: registered (uploaded with
``POST /v1/audio/voices`` and requested by name) and inline (``ref_audio`` /
``ref_text`` in the request body). Both run at concurrency 8 on one async-chunk server.

Controls run the same requests at concurrency 1, in async-chunk mode and with
``--no-async-chunk``, to show the scorer is clean when nothing is in flight. The swap
test feeds the reference clips back as outputs with two labels swapped, to show the
check can fail. It starts no server.

Voices: clone_2 (qwen3_tts), jiayan_zh (glm_tts) and indextts2. They are far apart under
both embedders; cosyvoice3/zero_shot_prompt.wav is not used because its outputs sit too
close to clone_2 for a reliable first-2 s check.
